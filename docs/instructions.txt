Conditions:

Screens Explained:
Screen 1
Home page with multiple buttons that act as questions. Once selected take the question and pass it to the next screen.

Screen 2
The chatbot response is to ask what CONDITION to search for. The conditions list: [‘cancer’, heart disease’, ‘asthma’]
If the condition is not in this list, tell the user there is no condition. If it’s a general question (not related to the condition) answer the users question but ask them for a condition.

Screen 3
Once a condition is typed in, confirm the condition. Yes or no button.

Screen 4
If no, repeat. If yes respond with “Searching for trials now…”.
